								<p class="p">Many features of organizational performance get blocked due to the inherent diversity of organizational membership that while bringing in healthy and necessary differences of perspectives also create conflicts and lack of synergy. Changing external environment on the one hand and shifting role expectations as managers move along different career stages on the other, require revisit of approaches to managing and leading. (influencing and leadership). Basic issues of re-examining assumptions of working and con-straining elements of organizational culture require urgent attention.<br/><br/>

While more comprehensive organization-wide approaches are available to address these issues we offer the following workshop based interventions that could then become the basis for larger interventions through diagnosis.</p>

Approaches based upon a compliant and submissive follower-ship is giving way to challenges of leading increasingly articulate & confident young employees. They increasingly want to be treated with equality and respect merit & competence over positional authority or exercise of power emanating from status differentials. These could be challenges facing project leaders in software organisations or department or functional heads in other companies.<br/><br/>
We engage with you and use different methodologies where participants understand their individual styles in teams and then have the opportunity engaging with behaviours that are more conducive to team membership.<br/><br/>
We engage to combine theoretical inputs with experiential learning through structured exercises and process observations on exhibited behaviour, its impact on people and situations and implications for leadership at work. Managers would be encouraged to examine the causes for functional as well as not so functional leadership behaviours and factors that may be coming in the way of exercise of certain action choices.

										Conflicts are a part of living reality in organisations & social systems. Individuals are inherently different because of several reasons including membership to different social groups, belonging to different professional disciplines, holding different values & beliefs etc. The paradox is that it is because of these differences that they are in the organization in the first place. However rather than respecting these differences and using them to advantage they are often perceived as threats and are either suppressed or denied. Such behaviours are also fuelled by strongly held assumptions that “ conflicts are bad & should not exist”. <br/><br/>

We help managers understand their own conflict management style and to reflect on the implications of their style on performance and working groups.
